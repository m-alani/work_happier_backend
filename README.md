# Work Happier

### A partial project we worked on @ QHacks 2017

We were aiming to build an Amazon Alexa hack where team-based work environments can track team morale, happiness, and mental health using voice!  
Alexa would ask the employees 2 questions everyday: "How are you doing this morning? (Starting their shift)", and "How was your day? (At the end of day)", and evaluate sentiment, emotions, and stress from their answers.

### Technologies & Languages
- Node.js
- Parse Platform
- Amazon Alexa Voice Services / SDK
- AWS (Elastic Beanstalk for hosting)
- AWS Lambda Functions
- MDL CSS
- Google Charts (JS)

### So why haven't you finished the project?
After an energetic day of hacking, we discovered that Amazon Alexa APIs do not allow to record and transcribe arbitrary voice answers from the user. That part is essential to get an answer from the employee about how their day is going/was.

### Ok, that sucks
Well, not entirely. We are still thankful to learn about:
- Parse Platform
- MDL
- Amazon Alexa
- AWS Services
- AWS Lambda Functions
- Requirements Gathering and **researching the technologies before you code a single line!** :)

Great attempt, with a great team!
